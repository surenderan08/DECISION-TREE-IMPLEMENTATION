# DECISION-TREE-IMPLEMENTATION_TASK 1

**COMPANY** : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME** : SURENDERAN R

**INTERN ID** : CT08DZZ

**DOMAIN** : MACHINE LEARNING

**BATCH DURATION** : DECEMBER 17th,2024 to JANUARY 17th,2025

## Project Overview
In this project, we:

- Load a dataset (in this case, the Iris dataset).
- Preprocess and split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier model.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics.
- Visualize the structure of the decision tree to understand how decisions are made based on the input features.

## Requirements
To run this project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas - for data handling
- numpy - for numerical operations
- scikit-learn - for machine learning
- matplotlib - for plotting and visualizing the decision tree

## Dataset
For this example, we are using the Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset for classification tasks. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and the corresponding species of the flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).You can easily replace this dataset with your own by loading it with pandas.read_csv() if you have a custom dataset.

## Code Structure
- decision_tree_classifier.py: The main Python script that implements the Decision Tree model.
- decision_tree_classifier.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook version of the project that showcases the step-by-step implementation.
- requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on demonstration of building and visualizing a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn. The decision tree model is highly interpretable, and visualization aids in understanding the decision-making process. This method is commonly used for classification tasks in various real-world applications.
